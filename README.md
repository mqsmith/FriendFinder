# FriendFinder

This application is essentially a simple dating app. [**Here**](https://friendfinder-gt-bootcamp.herokuapp.com/) is the link to the app on heroku.

## Technologies Used
JavaScript, node.js 
Dependencies: express, path

## Setup

First clone this repo to your local directory.

Next, navigate to your repo in your command terminal, and enter:

`npm install`

This will ensure you have all the necessary NPM packages installed to run this generator.

Feel free to load your own starter data into the `friends.js` file, or use the ones already in there. It's ok, I don't know them either.

## Overview

The home page of the app serves the purposes of telling you about the app.

Navigating to the `survey` page will present you with a 12 item questionnaire: name, photo link, and 10 questions to determine your fate.

All questions are required.

Clicking submit will generate your match and display it to you in a pop modal.
